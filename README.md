# CountryCityPerson
**A Sample Spring MVC CRUD Application with Thymeleaf, HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap4-based AdminLTE v3 template**

In this application, you can see a demonstration of using **Spring Boot**, **Spring Data JPA**, **MySQL**, **Spring MVC**, **Thymeleaf**, **HTML5**, **CSS3** and **Bootstrap** all together to build a foundational web application.

Currently code in this repo includes entity models for inter-related Country, City and Person database tables, as well as controllers and views for country and city.

Controllers and views for Person/People module not yet included in the repo (due to some refactoring work in progress).

MySQL database SQL dump is at the root directory in a file called countrycityperson.sql
